Finally built my first Machine Learning based project, It took almost 2 weeks to learn, understand, built and deploy the House Price Prediction Project, understood the basics of Machine Learning, what all I leaned while making this Project is mentioned below:

1. Learnt about basic steps in a regression based Ml algoithm, these are:
   1. Exploratory Analysis
   2. Visual Analysis
   3. Pre-Processing
   4. Data Transformation
   5. Create ML model
   6. Train and Evaluate model
2. Learnt to deploy the project as webpage/webpage on an online server.
3. Learnt few linux commands as well which are [wget](), [ssh]() etc
4. Got amazing resources for creating a project from scratch till deploying it.
5. Explored various aspects of  get/post requests, domains and sub domains.


The Project is working at [houseprediction.pranavkhurana.me](http://houseprediction.pranavkhurana.me)

You can also access the source code of my project in my repository, [House-Price-Predictor](https://github.com/Pranav-Khurana/House-Price-Predictor)
