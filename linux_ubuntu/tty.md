# tty

I was exploring my new OS _Linux Ubuntu_, the default python version in the same was a previous version, I tried updating
the same but lost my terminal, so while resolving the problem I learned about CUI, _Console User Interface_ or what we also call tty,
to activate the same we need to press the following key combination:

> alt + ctrl + f(n) ;where n could be any number between 2-7
