# Badges

I learned how to add badges to your GitHub repositories, you can easily add badges from [shields.io](https://shields.io/), they provide an easy way to add badges, but if you want custom made badges you can also create static and also dynamic badges as well. To create dynamic badges follow the given steps:

1. Create a JSON file in the repository in which you wish to add the badge.
2. Go to the raw link of the JSON file and copy the link.
3. Visit shields.io and in dynamic option 
	* Select datatype as JSON
	* add the label of your choice
	* In data URL field, paste the JSON file link
	* Query field must be the same as that of the key in JSON's key-value pair.
	* click on make badge and your badge is ready
4. Copy the badge link and add it your markdown file.
