# pull_upstream

I learned how to update my fork with the repository I have forked from, this is done by adding the repo you have forked from as an upstream and then pulling from upstream, to do so we need to do following:-

* Add the repo you have forked from as your upstream 

```
git remote add upstream URL_OF_REPOSITORY
```

* Pull the changes to your local copy of the forked repo

```
git pull upstream
```
