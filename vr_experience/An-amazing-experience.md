# An-amazing-experience

I learned about creating Virtual Reality games and softwares by using a platform called *hatchxr.com*. I also revisited the basic javascript and also got an experience of teaching. Over this one month period, I myself build some cool stuff and also taugh the same. Some of the great games I and my students made are:-

1. *Shooting Game*
: A VR based shooting game with great environment. Experience the 3D shooting game over [here](https://viewer.hatchxr.com/p/Pranav/Project1)
2. *Car Game* 
: A VR based car racing game(not fully functional yet). Not yet fully functional but you can still explore the stuff over [here](https://viewer.hatchxr.com/p/Pranav/Cargame)

My Students implemented following games in VR under my guidance:-

- The classic snake game
- Ping-Pong game
- Guess the door
